## Description

NewsHunter is a website where you can collect and organise news into different buckets, as well as browse other user's collections. (Think Pinterest, but for news)

## Demo (LIVE DEMO) ðŸ‘‡

> :warning: If you run into any problems, please start over at the above ðŸ‘† url.

> Please avoid refreshing when using the app and use just the NavBar for navigation since the entire website is hosted under index.html and when you visit other urls like https:://..//app/mainpage directly, it throws a 404 error. In the event that you encounter any issues, please start over at the index.html ðŸ‘† page.
